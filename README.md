This project simulates a mischievous Genie that responds to user wishes with twists, humor, and wordplay. The Genie aims to learn which types of twists users like the most and improve over time.

Work in Progress - 75% Complete

cat.py = Wish Categorization module

rl_agent.py = Q-Learning module

response.py = Response Generation module

main.py = Where all the modules are brought together

How it works:

1.Wish Categorization: When the user enters a wish, the system classifies it into one of the five categories: Object, Wealth, Experience, Random, or Knowledge/Ability. This helps the Genie decide which type of twist to use

2.Selecting a Twist Strategy: Based on the wish category, the Genie picks a "twist strategy" using Q-learning to see which twists are the most humorous. The twist strategies are: Literal, Substitution, Exaggerate, Opposite, and Puns

3.Response Generation: A language model uses the chosen strategy to reply with a funny response, twisting the wish

4.Receiving feedback and improving: The user rates as good, meh, or bad and the genie uses this feedback to update its Q-table and become funnier/more creative

5.Genie's memory: The Genie remembers what it learned by saving its Q-table and learning parameters between sessions to keep improving

Acknowledgements:
- Implemented and debugged primarily by me.
- I used ChatGPT occasionally to help with debugging code and understanding the details of implementation but all core design and logic were developed independently.
